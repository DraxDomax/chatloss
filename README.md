Crafty Http(s) Api Testing Library Of Sane Simplicity

Conceptualized by Todor Kolev on 5-Dec-2019. If this date is close to your current date, then I am probably still at the drawing board.

If you need to talk, I am here for you on: tk.chatloss@gmail.com

So far, my design goals are as follows:
A. Uses bespoke code wherever possible. Try to avoid dependencies at all costs.
   Reason: Relying on other people is a risk. Through my 20 years in the business, I keep hearing "no need to reinvent the wheel".
   However, "the wheel" is, at best, not perfectly suitable for "your car". In most cases, "the wheel" that's already invented is:
   1. Maintained by one guy who doesn't get paid, and the quality shows
   2. Depending on other readily-invented "wheels". So, you need to add 13 <dep'>s just to print a word out
   3. Using every single language feature the author has heard about because the author wants show he went to school
   4. Using deprecated components because the author hasn't learned anything new since school
B. Uses simple code that is easy to understand. Try to avoid "high flying" code at all costs.
   The idea here is to allow beginners maintain the code the best they can instead of forcing them to use language they can barely
   get compiling
C. Embrase all use cases. Don't patronize on users:
   User's boss: "we need to do this THAT way"
   User: "Dear community, how to do this THAT way?"
   Community: "LOL, are you stupid? Don't do this THAT way, here's how MY boss told me to do it"
   User: FML...

In the works: 
* Simple as a brick (and equally useful) HTTP/S client
* SOAP/REST support as standard
* Java and Python support
* Load testing support via optimized performance, multi-threading and load profile modelling
* Bespoke XML/JSON parsing and validation
* Out-of-the-box secrets manager so you don't include passwords in plaintext (don't do this!) like a clown
* REAL server with simple facility to mock your API
* Documentation for the framework components, usage guide and general things like API/Schema/Programming because I love you :)
